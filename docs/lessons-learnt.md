## Key Takeaways

### Why Phishing Works
Phishing is effective because it targets human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers rely on trust, urgency, and familiarity more than sophisticated exploits.

### Common User Weaknesses
- Rushing through emails without careful review  
- Trusting display names instead of verifying sender addresses  
- Clicking links without inspecting destination URLs  
- Assuming visual legitimacy equals authenticity  

### Defensive Lessons
- Email authentication mechanisms help, but they are not sufficient on their own  
- User awareness remains a critical layer of defense  
- Small inconsistencies in emails often reveal larger security issues  
- Thinking like an attacker strengthens defensive analysis and response
