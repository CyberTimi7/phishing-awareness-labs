# Methodology

This document outlines the approach used to conduct the ethical phishing campaign simulation in a controlled lab environment. The methodology focuses on understanding phishing mechanics while observing how modern email security controls detect and prevent malicious activity.

## Environment
- GoPhish (campaign management)
- Postfix (localhost SMTP testing)
- Kali Linux

## Approach
- Designed a simulated phishing scenario using custom email templates
- Configured a local mail transfer agent for test delivery
- Monitored delivery behavior and campaign results
- Analyzed defensive controls that blocked or flagged messages

## Scope and Limitations
- No real users were targeted
- No real credentials were collected
- Testing was limited to a lab environment
